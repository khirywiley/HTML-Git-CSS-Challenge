# HTML-Git-CSS-Challenge
This is the homework/challenge for week 1

I was tasked with making sure the website was meeting accessabilty standards so that it can populate more hits when being searched in search engines.

To achieve this I've added labels to images, links, and the title so that a screen reader would be able to read out what is being clicked on.
The link for the "search engine optimization" also didn't send a user down the page to its desired section so I made a class for that link.
